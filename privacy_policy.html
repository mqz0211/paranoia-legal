Last updated: 30/11/2025

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Paranoia Game Bot (“the Bot”) handles user information.

2. Data We Collect

The Bot does not store any personal data.
The Bot only temporarily processes the following information when you use commands:

User ID (for identifying Player A / Player B in a round)

Username and display name (to show game messages)

Interaction data (button clicks, slash commands, modal inputs)

All data is processed temporarily in memory and never saved to a database.

3. Ephemeral Interactions

Some features use Discord ephemeral messages, which are visible only to the user.
These messages are handled completely by Discord and are not stored.

4. Cookies or Tracking

The Bot does not use:

Cookies

Analytics

Logging systems

Third-party trackers

5. Sharing of Information

The Bot does not share, sell, or transmit data to any third parties.

6. Data Retention

The Bot stores no data.
All temporary data is deleted immediately after the command or round ends.

7. Children's Privacy

The Bot follows Discord’s minimum age requirement (13+ or your country’s equivalent).

8. Security

While the Bot does not store any data, we still use reasonable safeguards to ensure safe operation.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Your continued use of the Bot means you accept any changes.
